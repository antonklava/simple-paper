# Introduction

This is the introduction ^[Also, here is a footnote]. Here you can write what
your document will be about. This is the best thing ever [@Meyer2000
@Codishetal2000].

## Math

Here is inline math \(1+1=2\) and a math block:

\[
\theta = 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\sin^{2}\theta = 0
\]

## Code

Here is a code block

```{.ruby .numberLines}
array = %w(1 2 3)
squared = array.map{|n| n*n}
puts squared
```

## Image

Here is a figure
